            <h1>Fintech</h1>
            <p>
              Fintech, short for financial technology, refers to the integration
              of technology into financial services to improve their delivery
              and use. It encompasses a wide range of applications, from mobile
              banking and payment apps to investment platforms and
              cryptocurrencies.
            </p>
            <p>
              At its core, fintech aims to make financial processes more
              efficient and accessible for both businesses and consumers. This
              includes everything from transferring money via smartphone apps to
              using robo-advisors for investment management. Fintech also plays
              a significant role in enhancing financial inclusion by providing
              services to underserved populations.
